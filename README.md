# Pinewood Programming Language

This is quite obviously a work in progress :)

### Goals:

The goal of Pinewood is to give the user utmost freedom of structuring code in any way neccessary. This will be done via the use of a system of label and goto syntax that will allow going from one spot in the program to another.

The end product will be written completely in C or will be a Cython compiled version of the Python source code of the language.

### Join In!

### To Do:
