# Pinewood Programming Language
[![OSS Status: Healthy](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSS%20Status-Healthy-darkgreen.svg)](OSS_STATUS.md)

This is quite obviously a work in progress :)

### Goals:

The goal of Pinewood is to give the user utmost freedom of structuring code in any way neccessary. This will be done via the use of a system of label and goto syntax that will allow going from one spot in the program to another.

The end product will be written completely in C or will be a Cython compiled version of the Python source code of the language.

### Join In!

I am currently looking for people to collaborate with. 

### To Do:

- [X] Implement Numeric Arithmetic
- [ ] Implement Logic Arithmetic
- [ ] Implement if/then
- [ ] Implement labels and goto to enable looping and recursive code when paired with if/then
