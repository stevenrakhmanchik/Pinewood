This is quite obviously a work in progress :)

<bold>Need someone to help design a logo for the programming language so that we can be more "official"</bold>

### Goals:

The goal of Plywood is to give the user utmost freedom of structuring code in any way neccessary. This will be done via the use of a system of label and goto syntax that will allow going from one spot in the program to another.

The end product will be written completely in C or will be a Cython compiled version of the Python source code of the language.

### Join In!

I am currently looking for people to collaborate with on:

- Creating syntax highlighting and grammar rules via Tree-sitter for code editors to recognize Plywood <bold>(High Priority)</bold>
- Writing documentation and wiki
- Implementing more syntax features
- Developing libraries and a package system
- Literally anything else you want to suggest :)
 
Contact info is in github bio.

### To Do:

- [X] Implement Numeric Arithmetic
- [X] Implement Output
- [ ] Implement Logic Arithmetic
- [ ] Implement if/then
- [X] Implement labels and goto to enable looping and recursive code when paired with if/then
- Adding more soon
